# Slideshows

## Review Slideshows for Java at Brandeis University

These slideshows were created for reviewing before midterms and the finals for courses at Brandeis University. They should be useful to anyone learning Java at an intro level.

- [Intro Java Review Slides #1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19zhU2_FCLNG1BYiYvDdN4-n6AzCk_MgblPf6WPYEoGc/edit#slide=id.p) - Covers compiling programs, hello world program, ints doubles and using them, converting between int and double, modulus, strings, methods of strings, getting user input from scanners, creating and using methods, printing vs returning, scope in methods, using methods to avoid redundency, for loops (how to use them and what they can be used for), common problems with loops, nested for loops, practice problems)

- [Intro Java Review Slides #2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IsrEOGZ2VnVa-KLKWzoawvgft4UVBocYfxmkn6clwAQ/edit#slide=id.p) - Covers class constants, scope of variables in methods, the Math class, binary numbers (what they are, and converting between binary and decimal), adding/substracting binary numbers, char, String methods, booleans, relational operators, logical operations (and/or), combining operators, If/Else statements, Ternary operator, Switch statement, String processing, while loops, do while loops, generating random numbers, random class).

- [Intro Java Review Slides #3](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MtXnFcKNE0LEsu6uL3m12r9TwyxKOlXzW1XRKCuRsF4) - Covers arrays, initializing arrays, accessing elements of an array, looping through an array, calculating things about arrays, generating new arrays, 2D arrays, processing files, recursion, making a basic object.

- [Java Generic Objects Crash Course](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10Cj_z8h1Cvxr4aEAchDQPUqlJTKxz4_10w0QT-JgUhw/edit) - Crash course on java generic objects for Data Structures students who need to create their own data structures. Review of objects, how to make a generic object, how to use a generic object, making objects "comparable," compareTo method, how to use comparable object in generic object.


## Python Slideshows

[1 Hour Introduction to Python](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19h4-SJHI8i3Eapg7CSW2eUivN_4yD69eiGuj2yLIlp4/edit#slide=id.p) - Presentation made for SPLASH, a program for undergrad students teaching their own small classes. I taught a group of middle and high school students how to start programming in Python, and how to keep going after the class. Good for all age ranges.

[How to make a website with Python and Flask](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AQRvjxiCUtJOOHrDdmRpPyhjSNMWVi4am4vJjlD5Jdo/edit#slide=id.g2020205a98_0_0) - Good for someone who has learned Python, and wants to make their own website.

## General CS Education

[Hour of Code Talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TkN-hxmZ_CdiHnF6eYuUFdkbl4SZwGH8rL1MMCBivaU/edit#slide=id.p) - Hour of Code talk for biology teacher at Abby Kelley Foster Charter. Discusses what coding is, basic building blocks of coding, and case studies in Biology, Forensics and Anatomy. Lots of discussion questions that raise the big points of what computer science is about, and what the ethical questions surrounding it are.

## Cryptography

[Introduction to Cryptography](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MXfMufdQIRFoKF0JLBAseTfX56yeRR7TFsdMrzpSF7k/edit#slide=id.p) - Slides 1-15 are by myself. Slides 16 on are by [Seth Rait](http://www.sethrait.com).

[How listen to someone's password](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/1/d/1sAhMdgUiTs32AnYxYuHB2jB0LaWFZFEsJbyZf1K0czk/edit?usp=drive_web) - A talk about a paper by Adi Shamir Et Al.

[Finding information from VOIP conversations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/1/d/1_ZZyHKuyNKhqHfgvdSf3ts1WJT4gqhO0AtS7GRO7Zq4/edit?usp=drive_web) - Another presentation on a paper.

# Programming Assignments

These are assignments that I wrote for various programming classes. They are good for giving to students, or trying to do yourself to learn the subjects or reinforce material you've learned.

[Calculating Grades for Teacher](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xqoqx-_7VUghweE817hP9uqSGy8khdJTL5-yQQjorBc/edit) - Programming assignment heavy on array calculations.

[Designing a card game](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zqIqzH163VFJjA8OZHs3JfjwubAazAxsemnibHVQY0k/edit) - Good for someone in a course about Java who is comfortable with arrays, and has started learning about objects. The assignment can be done with the basics of objects, with no knowledge of inheritence.

[Designing Uno](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1N8eNwsbuhkPP-i6z_oNt1eVDVuT330UZNYOOPi6yGHU/edit?usp=drive_web) - Good assignment for Data Structures students for learning how to create your own linkedlist, and how to use it in a game of Uno.
