# Introduction

Within the STEM community, it's fairly common to see people hold their education as more important than people who study humanities. These "STEM Majors" have an aura of superiority to them, asserting that their classes are the hardest, and making sure everyone around them knows. You've probably seen memes like the one below mocking non STEM majors, and the one below that mocking STEM majors who mock non STEM majors.

It's also common to assume that for jobs such as software engineering, the hard technical skills are the most important, and to be competitive at your job you should focus on taking the hardest STEM classes you possibly can. Some technical schools double down on this ideology by making their CS students take classes in physics and chemistry, to instill a hardcore engineering mindset into their students. Even if schools do not require students to be rigorously involved in computer science, students in STEM and computer science often self select to take more CS classes over classes in other departments. Presumably, they do this because they think the hard science classes will improve their skills, they will impress recruiters and tech companies, and that the humanities classes will be a waste of time and tuition money.

In this blog post, I will argue the opposite really, that the "soft skills" that come from the humanities are incredibly important, if not essential to being a good software engineer. Many people believe that software engineering is a strictly hard skill, and your success as a software engineer will come from how good of a coder you are. This is even used as an excuse to claim that women are less likely to go into software engineering, since they are more focused on "communication" and "people skills". However, my experience as a software engineer at Google/YouTube has shown me the complete opposite: the most successful software engineers are the ones who can successfully communicate their ideas to a larger audience, and understand the larger scope of their work. I talk to a lot of students about software engineering careers, and it always blows their minds when I tell them this, so I'm hoping by the end of this post to convince you that people with these soft skills are very needed in tech, and we should be focusing on these skills. I'll be focusing on software engineering in specific since that's what I do, but many of these points apply to other STEM fields as well.

# What are the Humanities

Before talking about why they're important, it's probably good to have a good definition of "the humanities." Here is one (from the Stanford Humanities Center)[http://shc.stanford.edu/what-are-the-humanities]:

>The humanities can be described as the study of how people process and document the human experience. Since humans have been able, we have used philosophy, literature, religion, art, music, history and language to understand and record our world. These modes of expression have become some of the subjects that traditionally fall under the humanities umbrella. Knowledge of these records of human experience gives us the opportunity to feel a sense of connection to those who have come before us, as well as to our contemporaries.

So basically, the humanities can be described as the study of fields which relate to the human experience, but in a more subjective way than something like math or science. Classes in these fields generally revolve around reading books or historical documents, listening to music, watching films, and digesting many other mediums to try to understand the subject matter at hand. The subject could be as broad as "world music", or as narrow as "The 18th Century French Court." As opposed to strict testing, many classes in the humanities instead focus on essay writing and idea communication, to see how well students can form and communicate arguments about the subject matter at hand. Often these assessments are much more subjective than the ones in STEM classes, where there aren't clear "right" or "wrong" answers, but rather "good" or "bad" arguments. The classes will also feature many class discussions and student lead presentations on their independent research, which from my experience are much less common in STEM classes. These classes really teach students how to reason about their subject material in a holistic way, and communicate their ideas about the subject matter orally and in writing.

# My Background

Also before I begin explaining my argument, I just wanted to share a bit about my background, since it's always good to see where people come from before listening to them :)

I come from a unique position - my education at [Brandeis University](http://cs.brandeis.edu) was a bit different than what most people seemed to get for computer science. While other schools have fairly intense requirements for CS majors to take science, math, and hardcore CS classes, Brandeis' requirements were [fairly lax](Add link to Appendix). For a Bachelor of Arts, the only math class that was required was Discrete Math, and for a BS you just needed to add a few more to that. If someone wanted a rigorous CS education, it was mostly up to them to seek out the hard classes in machine learning, algorithms, systems, or whatever other advanced topics interested them.

Instead, Brandeis really encouraged interdisciplinary thinking, by having very broad general education requirements which require students to take a class in every school, in addition to writing classes and other requirements (see Appendix). This encouraged students in the sciences to take interesting humanities classes, and vice versa. Additionally, Brandeis really encouraged students pursue multiple majors, which is very unusual for universities. Here is a quote from the [academic website](http://www.brandeis.edu/admissions/academics/majors.html):

> Brandeis students may choose from a variety of majors and minors offered in four broad areas: the creative arts, the humanities, the sciences and the social sciences. A number of these programs are interdisciplinary by design and draw faculty from several different departments. Nearly half of our undergraduates pursue a double major, often in fields on opposite ends of the academic spectrum. Students may pursue up to a triple-major and/or triple-minor.

Since it was so encouraged, and because I was a band geek in high school, I decided to pursue a double major in computer science as well as music. This was a very cool opportunity for me, as I definitely would not have been able to put as much effort into understanding and performing music otherwise. I got to play lute and recorder in an early music ensemble at Brandeis (which was one of the best experiences of my life), and got to take extra classes in music history, theory, and composition. I definitely put more effort into my computer science degree, and would not stand a fighting chance competing against other music majors from other universities, but I really appreciated this rounding out of my education. In a way, the two majors really complimented each other - when I was sick of CS I could work on music, and vice versa. Additionally, I could use my knowledge of music to work on personal projects related to music, or work with professors for cross collaborative work. These projects were always my favorite to work on, and my passion really showed in the end results. For example, [here]() is a 24 hour project from HackMIT where my team made a touchpad that played music, and [this]() is my final project for an electronic composition class where I made a JavaScript improvisation algorithm.

Now that I'm graduated from college, and have entered the workforce (dun dun dun), I'm really starting to appreciate having taken these extra classes in the humanities, which have strengthened my writing abilities and communication skill. I wish I had taken some more classes in college such as machine learning or linear algebra, but I'm happy with the tradeoffs I made. It's a very different part of the brain that's exercised in these classes, but that part of the brain is extremely important for the work I do now. So without further ado, here are my reasons why humanities skills are important for software jobs.

# Communicating With Others

## Other Engineers

When people think of software engineers, they may think of some lonely hacker sitting in a dark basement somewhere, pumping out code for hours at a speeds of 100 WPM. They may occasionally get a ping from their boss asking them to do something, and then three days later have it done for them:  [Source](https://www.123rf.com/stock-photo/coder.html).

![concentrated young software developer eating pizza and coding at home](https://previews.123rf.com/images/vadymvdrobot/vadymvdrobot1602/vadymvdrobot160200414/51967672-profile-of-concentrated-young-software-developer-eating-pizza-and-coding-at-home.jpg)

This may be true for some software jobs, but at least for mine, it could not be farther from the truth. I am constantly talking with other engineers on the team to try to learn how the current codebase works, get ideas on how to build certain features or fix certain bugs, or discussing future plans or optimizations. These discussions are happening all the time, and being a good communicator means that you'll be able to clearly and efficiently work with other developers, by talking through these ideas with them and clearly explaining your thoughts on certain proposals.

Communicating with other engineers is a large part of software job interviews. The focus of your interview will be working through whatever problems your interviewer is giving you, but they aren't only grading you on getting the "right answer." If you're interviewing at a company with a good interview system, they're going to mostly be looking at how you work with the interviewer to come up with an answer. You're going to need to take what the interviewer says, come up with ideas for solutions, communicate these solutions to your interviewer, listen to their feedback, incorporate that into your solution, and then communicate your solution while coding. Even if you have a perfect algorithm for the coding question you were given, if you just write the answer out with no communication, that will not be a good interview. The interviewers are looking for strong engineers who are also able to communicate their ideas well and work with others.

## Non-Engineers

Communication skills are also important for communicating with non engineers. The amount of this communication depends on your exact job, but your role may have you talking directly with product managers, UX designers, lawyers, community members, users, or even customers directly. In these cases, you will have to communicate your technical ideas in a way that can be understood by someone who may have never written any code before. They will have questions about how your code works or whether certain features are possible. It will be up to you to explain these things in clear ways, so that there is no ambiguity for the other stakeholders. In the case of working with customers directly, you will have to be able to communicate with them in a way that leaves no ambiguity to the end product, and explain to them what is possible and what is not feasible in the scope of the project. You will also have to set expectations with them, and even convince them that certain features they have in mind will not be necessary. I had a job in college building a web app for a social science lab on campus, and the hardest part was not the code, but rather explaining to the PI of the lab that I could not recreate SQL for them inside the app.

## Writing

Software engineering is also surprisingly a lot of writing! There was one week recently where I was writing no code, just writing up documents related to my job. The main offender here is design documents: at Google and many other companies, any large feature or plan must come with a comprehensive document that explains what you want to do, why you want to do it, your proposed solutions, and what the pros/cons of those solutions are. This process may take days to weeks to finalize, with engineers from your team debating and discussing all of the ideas. If you write a good design document, you'll be able to clearly explain the great engineering ideas in your head to everyone else, and you'll be able to get clear feedback on them without any miscommunication. Additionally, these documents are priceless for the future, when someone wants to go back and see why a certain feature was built. In this case, they will be able to see your design doc, and clearly understand why you did something, and hopefully learn from it so they don't have to reinvent the wheel. A good design document will save many engineering hours, make sure the product of those engineering efforts are the best they can be, and will preserve those ideas for anyone who needs them in the future.

There is also writing for the process of performance ratings and promotions. At Google, every performance cycle, you need to make the case for why your work is demonstrative of your current engineering (level)[https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-different-levels-of-software-engineers-at-Google]." Additionally, if you're trying to get promoted, you have to make an even stronger case for why your work is indicative of the next engineering level. Of course you actually need to do the work to demonstrate these things, but you also have to have the writing and communication ability to explain why your projects are indicative of good work with high impact - and doing something like harping on inconsequential details won't help you there. Additionally, having well written design documents will help prove your case for a good performance review, as the technical challenges you've overcome will be clearly explained in the document you've already written. In this case, your communication skills have a direct effect on your software career and compensation, so it's important to know how to clearly communicate your contributions to your team.

Besides the larger documents, there are also other short documents or presentations you may have to give. You may have to write a document on how a certain feature works, describe the results of an experiment, or even write a postmortem document if something you built breaks. In all of these cases, the other engineers you're communicating to will benefit greatly from clear and concise documentation, so that the messages you're trying to write about get understood. Your job may also involve you writing an API that is accessible to the public. If that's the case, then your audience isn't just engineers at your company, but rather engineers all over the world. In that case, you will have to write a lot of technical documentation on how to use the API, what each endpoint does, and include examples to make sure nobody gets confused. I love whenever companies go out of their way to make API documentation accessible and easy to understand, and I cringe whenever an API's documentation is so bad that I have to look at their source code to see what it's actually doing. Your software may be amazing, but if the documentation is confusing, nobody will use it.

There are also the small points of communication. You have emails to and from teammates, comments in your code, git commit messages, comments in bug reports, comments in code reviews, and comments on other people's documents. These items may seem small, but they have large effects. All of these are used to communicate ideas to other engineers, so they understand what is going on in the specific context. These small places for communication need to be taken very seriously, and the engineers who can write good comments will make things significantly easier for everyone else, especially after the fact when these comments will be read to get context of the situation at that time. These "artifacts" of your work and technical ability can also be referenced by the performance documents above, to display your work in a positive light.

## Reading

In addition to writing, there is also a lot of reading in software engineering. I mean, that's what you're doing right now, right? The great software engineers I know read a **lot** from other software engineers. Software engineers have to read language tutorials, software documentation, books on software engineering, blog posts, design documents, and stack overflow comments. Growing and developing the ability to read these types of documentation is extremely important, as well as the ability to reason about and retain the information in them, so you can learn from them and grow as a software engineer. Especially since the world of software engineering is constantly evolving, it's important to keep up to date with what's going on out there, and reading is the best way to do that.

## Conclusion

Hopefully this is not a very controversial point - we've all had to either deal with a professor or student who is extremely talented in science, but were absolutely unable to communicate their ideas to other people. To get information from them, you have to incessantly ask them very directed questions and hope that gets you the information you need, or just give up working with them in general. If not a person, then you've definitely seen poorly written software documentation, or even an offhand Stack Overflow comment that is absolutely impossible to understand. In that moment, you probably wish that whoever wrote it took the time to properly communicate their ideas, and had the skills to be able to do so. In a way, I'm writing this blog to improve my writing and communication skills, so I can bring them back to my work.

# Understanding the larger scope of your work

# Understand the user.

Why a humanities education is important for Software Engineers:

- Aids in communicating with other software engineers.
 - Mention interviews
- Aids in communicating with non-software people (product manager, non tech teams, outside firms, etc...)
- Writing technical documentation, bug reports, emails, etc...
- Helps with understanding the larger scope of the impact of your work.
- Helps with reading and understanding documentation other people wrote.
- Helps create features and products that people will actually find useful. Help exit the "engineering" mindset.

Conclusion:
- What to make of all of this
- What to do for skills
- What to do if you're in charge of a program

Hey everyone! This post is a little bit of a deviation from what I normally talk about on this blog. It's normally a place where I like to talk and teach about certain technical topics that I'm interested in, such as interviews, learning python, studying CS in college, or starting web development. However, finding where a humanities education fits into computer science  is a topic I've been very interested in talking about, and so I hope it can spark some interesting conversations.
