Why a humanities education is important for Software Engineers:

- Aids in communicating with other software engineers.
 - Mention interviews
- Aids in communicating with non-software people (product manager, non tech teams, outside firms, etc...)
- Writing technical documentation, bug reports, emails, etc...
- Helps with understading the larger scope of the impact of your work.
- Helps with reading and understanding documentation other people wrote.
- Helps create features that people will actually find useful.
