# Introduction

Within the STEM community, it's fairly common to see people hold their education as more important than people who study humanities. These "STEM Majors" have an aura of superiority to them, asserting that their classes are the hardest, and making sure everyone around them knows. You've probably seen memes like the one below mocking non STEM majors, and the one below that mocking STEM majors who mock non STEM majors.

It's also common to assume that for jobs such as software engineering, the hard technical skills are the most important, and to be competitive at your job you should focus on taking the hardest STEM classes you possibly can. Some technical schools double down on this ideology by making their CS students take classes in physics and chemistry, to instill a hardcore engineering mindset into their students. Even if schools do not require students to be rigorously involved in computer science, students in STEM and computer science often self select to take more CS classes over classes in other departments. Presumably, they do this because they think the hard science classes will improve their skills, they will impress recruiters and tech companies, and that the humanities classes will be a waste of time and tuition money.

In this blog post, I will argue the opposite really, that the "soft skills" that come from the humanities are incredibly important, if not essential to being a good software engineer. Many people believe that software engineering is a strictly hard skill, and your success as a software engineer will come from how good of a coder you are. This is even used as an excuse to claim that women are less likely to go into software engineering, since they are more focused on "communication" and "people skills". However, my experience as a software engineer at Google/YouTube has shown me the complete opposite: the most successful software engineers are the ones who can successfully communicate their ideas to a larger audience, and understand the larger scope of their work. I talk to a lot of students about software engineering careers, and it always blows their minds when I tell them this, so I'm hoping by the end of this post to convince you that people with these soft skills are very needed in tech, and we should be focusing on these skills. I'll be focusing on software engineering in specific since that's what I do, but many of these points apply to other STEM fields as well.

# What are the Humanities

Before talking about why they're important, it's probably good to have a good definition of "the humanities." Here is one (from the Stanford Humanities Center)[http://shc.stanford.edu/what-are-the-humanities]:

>The humanities can be described as the study of how people process and document the human experience. Since humans have been able, we have used philosophy, literature, religion, art, music, history and language to understand and record our world. These modes of expression have become some of the subjects that traditionally fall under the humanities umbrella. Knowledge of these records of human experience gives us the opportunity to feel a sense of connection to those who have come before us, as well as to our contemporaries.

So basically, the humanities can be described as the study of fields which relate to the human experience, but in a more subjective way than something like math or science. Classes in these fields generally revolve around reading books or historical documents, listening to music, watching films, and digesting many other mediums to try to understand the subject matter at hand. The subject could be as broad as "world music", or as narrow as "The 18th Century French Court." As opposed to strict testing, many classes in the humanities instead focus on essay writing and idea communication, to see how well students can form and communicate arguments about the subject matter at hand. Often these assessments are much more subjective than the ones in STEM classes, where there aren't clear "right" or "wrong" answers, but rather "good" or "bad" arguments. The classes will also feature many class discussions and student lead presentations on their independent research, which from my experience are much less common in STEM classes. These classes really teach students how to reason about their subject material in a holistic way, and communicate their ideas about the subject matter orally and in writing.

# My Background

Also before I begin explaining my argument, I just wanted to share a bit about my background, since it's always good to see where people come from before listening to them!

I come from a unique position - my education at [Brandeis University](http://cs.brandeis.edu) was a bit different than what most people seemed to get for computer science. While other schools have fairly intense requirements for CS majors to take science, math, and hardcore CS classes, Brandeis' requirements were [fairly lax](Add link to Appendix). For a Bachelor of Arts, the only math class that was required was Discrete Math, and for a BS you just needed to add a few more to that. If someone wanted a rigorous CS education, it was mostly up to them to seek out the hard classes in machine learning, algorithms, systems, or whatever other advanced topics interested them.

Instead, Brandeis really encouraged interdisciplinary thinking, by having very broad general education requirements which require students to take a class in every school, in addition to writing classes and other requirements (see Appendix). This encouraged students in the sciences to take interesting humanities classes, and vice versa. Additionally, Brandeis really encouraged students pursue multiple majors, which is very unusual for universities. Here is a quote from the [academic website](http://www.brandeis.edu/admissions/academics/majors.html):

> Brandeis students may choose from a variety of majors and minors offered in four broad areas: the creative arts, the humanities, the sciences and the social sciences. A number of these programs are interdisciplinary by design and draw faculty from several different departments. Nearly half of our undergraduates pursue a double major, often in fields on opposite ends of the academic spectrum. Students may pursue up to a triple-major and/or triple-minor.

Since it was so encouraged, and because I was a band geek in high school, I decided to pursue a double major in computer science as well as music. This was a very cool opportunity for me, as I definitely would not have been able to put as much effort into understanding and performing music otherwise. I got to play lute and recorder in an early music ensemble at Brandeis (which was one of the best experiences of my life), and got to take extra classes in music history, theory, and composition. I definitely put more effort into my computer science degree, and would not stand a fighting chance competing against other music majors from other universities, but I really appreciated this rounding out of my education. In a way, the two majors really complimented each other - when I was sick of CS I could work on music, and vice versa. Additionally, I could use my knowledge of music to work on personal projects related to music, or work with professors for cross collaborative work. These projects were always my favorite to work on, and my passion really showed in the end results. For example, [here]() is a 24 hour project from HackMIT where my team made a touchpad that played music, and [this]() is my final project for an electronic composition class where I made a JavaScript improvisation algorithm.

Now that I'm graduated from college, and have entered the workforce (dun dun dun), I'm really starting to appreciate having taken these extra classes in the humanities, which have strengthened my writing abilities and communication skill. I wish I had taken some more classes in college such as machine learning or linear algebra, but I'm happy with the tradeoffs I made. It's a very different part of the brain that's exercised in these classes, but that part of the brain is extremely important for the work I do now. I'm also not claiming that I'm some humanities god, with amazing writing and communication skills - I'm far from it actually. I actually started this blog because I wanted to try to improve my technical communication skills, since I noticed that they were lacking. I'm just sharing what I've found to be useful skills for software engineers that are not often talked about. So without further ado, here are my reasons why humanities skills are important for software jobs.

# Communicating With Others

## Other Engineers

When people think of software engineers, they may think of some lonely hacker sitting in a dark basement somewhere, pumping out code for hours at a speeds of 100 WPM. They may occasionally get a ping from their boss asking them to do something, and then three days later have it done for them:  [Source](https://www.123rf.com/stock-photo/coder.html).

![concentrated young software developer eating pizza and coding at home](https://previews.123rf.com/images/vadymvdrobot/vadymvdrobot1602/vadymvdrobot160200414/51967672-profile-of-concentrated-young-software-developer-eating-pizza-and-coding-at-home.jpg)

This may be true for some software jobs, but at least for mine, it could not be farther from the truth. I am constantly talking with other engineers on the team to try to learn how the current codebase works, get ideas on how to build certain features or fix certain bugs, or discussing future plans or optimizations. These discussions are happening all the time, and being a good communicator means that you'll be able to clearly and efficiently work with other developers, by talking through these ideas with them and clearly explaining your thoughts on certain proposals.

Communicating with other engineers is a large part of software job interviews. The focus of your interview will be working through whatever problems your interviewer is giving you, but they aren't only grading you on getting the "right answer." If you're interviewing at a company with a good interview system, they're going to mostly be looking at how you work with the interviewer to come up with an answer. You're going to need to take what the interviewer says, come up with ideas for solutions, communicate these solutions to your interviewer, listen to their feedback, incorporate that into your solution, and then communicate your solution while coding. Even if you have a perfect algorithm for the coding question you were given, if you just write the answer out with no communication, that will not be a good interview. The interviewers are looking for strong engineers who are also able to communicate their ideas well and work with others.

## Non-Engineers

Communication skills are also important for communicating with non engineers. The amount of this communication depends on your exact job, but your role may have you talking directly with product managers, UX designers, lawyers, community members, users, or even customers directly. In these cases, you will have to communicate your technical ideas in a way that can be understood by someone who may have never written any code before. They will have questions about how your code works or whether certain features are possible. It will be up to you to explain these things in clear ways, so that there is no ambiguity for the other stakeholders. In the case of working with customers directly, you will have to be able to communicate with them in a way that leaves no ambiguity to the end product, and explain to them what is possible and what is not feasible in the scope of the project. You will also have to set expectations with them, and even convince them that certain features they have in mind will not be necessary. I had a job in college building a web app for a social science lab on campus, and the hardest part was not the code, but rather explaining to the PI of the lab that I could not recreate SQL for them inside the app.

## Writing

Software engineering is also surprisingly a lot of writing! There was one week recently where I was writing no code, just writing up documents related to my job. The main offender here is design documents: at Google and many other companies, any large feature or plan must come with a comprehensive document that explains what you want to do, why you want to do it, your proposed solutions, and what the pros/cons of those solutions are. This process may take days to weeks to finalize, with engineers from your team debating and discussing all of the ideas. If you write a good design document, you'll be able to clearly explain the great engineering ideas in your head to everyone else, and you'll be able to get clear feedback on them without any miscommunication. Additionally, these documents are priceless for the future, when someone wants to go back and see why a certain feature was built. In this case, they will be able to see your design doc, and clearly understand why you did something, and hopefully learn from it so they don't have to reinvent the wheel. A good design document will save many engineering hours, make sure the product of those engineering efforts are the best they can be, and will preserve those ideas for anyone who needs them in the future.

There is also writing for the process of performance ratings and promotions. At Google, every performance cycle, you need to make the case for why your work is demonstrative of your current engineering (level)[https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-different-levels-of-software-engineers-at-Google]." Additionally, if you're trying to get promoted, you have to make an even stronger case for why your work is indicative of the next engineering level. Of course you actually need to do the work to demonstrate these things, but you also have to have the writing and communication ability to explain why your projects are indicative of good work with high impact - and doing something like harping on inconsequential details won't help you there. Additionally, having well written design documents will help prove your case for a good performance review, as the technical challenges you've overcome will be clearly explained in the document you've already written. In this case, your communication skills have a direct effect on your software career and compensation, so it's important to know how to clearly communicate your contributions to your team.

Besides the larger documents, there are also other short documents or presentations you may have to give. You may have to write a document on how a certain feature works, describe the results of an experiment, or even write a postmortem document if something you built breaks. In all of these cases, the other engineers you're communicating to will benefit greatly from clear and concise documentation, so that the messages you're trying to write about get understood. Your job may also involve you writing an API that is accessible to the public. If that's the case, then your audience isn't just engineers at your company, but rather engineers all over the world. In that case, you will have to write a lot of technical documentation on how to use the API, what each endpoint does, and include examples to make sure nobody gets confused. I love whenever companies go out of their way to make API documentation accessible and easy to understand, and I cringe whenever an API's documentation is so bad that I have to look at their source code to see what it's actually doing. Your software may be amazing, but if the documentation is confusing, nobody will use it.

There are also the small points of communication. You have emails to and from teammates, comments in your code, git commit messages, comments in bug reports, comments in code reviews, and comments on other people's documents. These items may seem small, but they have large effects. All of these are used to communicate ideas to other engineers, so they understand what is going on in the specific context. These small places for communication need to be taken very seriously, and the engineers who can write good comments will make things significantly easier for everyone else, especially after the fact when these comments will be read to get context of the situation at that time. These "artifacts" of your work and technical ability can also be referenced by the performance documents above, to display your work in a positive light.

## Reading

In addition to writing, there is also a lot of reading in software engineering. I mean, that's what you're doing right now, right? The great software engineers I know read a **lot** from other software engineers. Software engineers have to read language tutorials, software documentation, books on software engineering, blog posts, design documents, and stack overflow comments. Growing and developing the ability to read these types of documentation is extremely important, as well as the ability to reason about and retain the information in them, so you can learn from them and grow as a software engineer. Especially since the world of software engineering is constantly evolving, it's important to keep up to date with what's going on out there, and reading is the best way to do that.

Besides reading technical documentation, it's also useful to read generally about the world around us. There are plenty of books related to software which are not technical documentation, but about the history of some technology or software, or about the personalities behind tech. It's extremely valuable to have context behind this technical world we're in, and having an aptitude for reading can come in handy. It's also just nice to be able to go to the beach and read a book about a subject you're genuinely interested in.

## Conclusion on Communication

Hopefully this is not a very controversial point - we've all had to either deal with a professor or student who is extremely talented in science, but were absolutely unable to communicate their ideas to other people. To get information from them, you have to incessantly ask them very directed questions and hope that gets you the information you need, or just give up working with them in general. If not a person, then you've definitely seen poorly written software documentation, or even an offhand Stack Overflow comment that is absolutely impossible to understand. In that moment, you probably wish that whoever wrote it took the time to properly communicate their ideas, and had the skills to be able to do so. At the same time, hopefully you've had some good experiences with communicating with engineers: a beautiful API documentation, or a very charismatic speaker at a conference perhaps. As engineers, we should always strive towards the second one.

# Understanding the larger scope of your work

## Case Study: IBM and the Holocaust

***CONTENT WARNING***: There is some discussion of the Holocaust in this section, including graphic quotes. The source for all of this information and all the quotes are from the wonderful book IBM and the Holocaust. If you cannot stomach holocaust discussions, please skip to the next section.

As engineers, we're often bogged down by technical details of our work. We're asked to create efficient algorithms that can be managed over a certain QPS with low latency, and few network connections. These are all important technical questions, but there are other important questions when building software which raise questions beyond the technical scope.

One of the most egregious example of "software" being used for wrong is the use of IBM Hollerith card sorting machines in Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. I use software in quotes because it's not technically software, but it's basically the same idea, hardware programmed to do a specific task. In 1890, Herman Hollerith patented a card sorting machine, inspired by the inefficiency of the US census. Each card would have some data about some entity, and the machines could sort this data based on arbitrary columns. If you know CS, you know the power of sorting algorithms like merge sort which runs in n*log(n) time, and you can imagine the benefits this machine would have in optimizations and quick turnarounds. This technology was amazing to the US Census, and saved them significant time and money in terms of being able to categorize [1]().


This technology was extremely profitable, and several governments paid to lease this technology, making specific punch cards and sorting machines for each use case.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jJH2alRcx4M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Eventually, the technology went into the hands of IBM, which was at the time run by Thomas J. Watson. Watson was an incredibly effective salesman, and was motivated by selling as much as possible. He was ruthless in business, and had almost a cult like personality surrounding himself at IBM. This drive for success is what lead him to deal with any client, no matter how morally abhorrent.

This client of course is Nazi Germany, probably the epitome of what people consider evil. To quote IBM and The Holocaust on IBM's involvement:

> [Watson's] company, IBM – one of the biggest in the world – custom-designed and leased the Hollerith card sorting system to the Third Reich for use at Bergen-Belsen and most of the other concentration camps. International Business Machines also serviced its machines almost monthly, and trained Nazi personnel to use the intricate systems. Duplicate copies of code books were kept in IBM’s offices in case field books were lost. What’s more, his company was the exclusive source for up to 1.5 billion punch cards the Reich required each year to run its machines.

You cannot say that Watson and the engineers who worked for IBM did not know about the abhorrent use case of these punch cards. For one, Adolf Hitler's intentions were extremely well laid out.

> WHEN HITLER came to power, in January 1933, he made an open promise to create a Master Race, dominate Europe, and decimate European Jewry. Numberless racial laws – local and national – appeared throughout the country.

In the coming months, Nazi Germany banned Jewish businesses from advertising, Jewish people were captured and tortured in the streets, and concentration camps for political prisoners and Jews would be established. The Nazis used Jews as the scapegoat to many of society's problems, and claimed that they wanted to  This was not unknown to the world, as there were over 100,000 protestors in New York spreading this news, and frequent New York Times stories. There was even a boycott of companies that did business with Germany, but IBM was not targeted, as the power of the punch card machines was not obvious, and IBM did business in Germany through a holding company. But Watson was extremely involved in the design and execution of punch cards running Nazi Germany, as he basically saw dollar signs ready to be made.

> Watson was no Fascist. He was a pure capitalist. But the horseshoe of political economics finds little distance between extremities. Accretion of wealth by and for the state under a strong autocratic leader fortified by jingoism and hero worship was appealing to Watson. After all, his followers wore uniforms, sang songs, and were expected to display unquestioned loyalty to the company he led.

> Nazi Germany offered Watson the opportunity to cater to government control, supervision, surveillance, and regimentation on a plane never before known in human history. The fact that Hitler planned to extend his Reich to other nations only magnified the prospective profits. In business terms, that was account growth. The technology was almost exclusively IBM’s to purvey because the firm controlled about 90 percent of the world market in punch cards and sorters.103
As for the moral dilemma, it simply did not exist for IBM. Supplying the Nazis with the technology they needed was not even debated.

Previous to the punch cards, the Nazis could not systematically attack Jews and other races considered non pure. They were not able to really find the previously Jewish families who have since converted and assimilated, as many did. However, these punch cards allowed the Nazis to systematically target specific populations, and be very specific about their needs. For example, they were extremely concerned with bloodlines, and as such targeted anyone who had any Jewish in their blood, even if they were practicing Christians. Once punched, the cards could generate lists of anyone with Jewish grandparents. In a modern database, you can imagine that as a horrifying SQL query.


> At the vanguard of Hitler’s intellectual shock troops were the statisticians. Naturally, statistical offices and census departments were Dehomag’s number one clients. In their journals, Nazi statistical experts boasted of what they expected their evolving science to deliver. All of their high expectations depended on the continuing innovation of IBM punch cards and tabulator technology. Only Dehomag could design and execute systems to identify, sort, and quantify the population to separate Jews from Aryans.

> In the absence of an explicit law defining exactly who in Germany was a Jew, Nazi persecution was far from hermetic. For years, such a definition would have been a cloudy exercise. Even if Nazis could agree on such an exegesis, no one could back up the definition with hard data. Since the advent of the Third Reich, thousands of Jews nervously assumed they could hide from the Aryan clause.

> But Jews could not hide from millions of punch cards thudding through Hollerith machines, comparing names across generations, address changes across regions, family trees and personal data across unending registries. It did not matter that the required forms or questionnaires were filled in by leaking pens and barely sharpened pencils, only that they were later tabulated and sorted by IBM’s precision technology.

Using his Nazi connections, Watson was able to secure the Nazi census as a contract, and began working on the whole thing. The Nazis had 500,000 census takers through the country, taking the names and other information of all its citizens under coersion. They then employed data punchers, who could take this data and transfer it to the coded punch cards which could be sorted based on the Nazi race scientist's whims. Mixed with medical data, they could find Jews, gypsies, disabled people, people with disease in the family, any people with any other characteristics that were not in line with the "master race." These people would be targeted for mass sterilization, loss of citizenship and the right to work, theft of property, and of course mass genocide.

> Throughout 1935, race specialists, bolstered by population computations and endless tabular printouts, proffered their favorite definitions of Jewishness. Some theorems were so sweeping as to include even the faintest Jewish ancestry. But most tried to create pseudo-scientific castes limited in scope. These latter efforts would encompass not only full Jews who professed the religion or possessed four Jewish grandparents, but also the so-called three-quarter, half, and one-quarter Jews of lesser Jewish lineage.

> Hitler wanted the Jews identified en masse. Once drafted, the Nuremberg regulations would be completely dependent upon Hollerith technology for the fast, wholesale tracing of Jewish family trees that the Reich demanded. Hollerith systems offered the Reich the speed and scope that only an automated system could to identify not only half and quarter Jews, but even eighth and sixteenth Jews.

> In the sterilization program’s first year, 1934, more than 84,600 cases brought to the Genetic Health Courts resulted in 62,400 forced sterilizations. In 1935, 88,100 genetic trials yielded 71,700 forced sterilizations.
> Eventually, sterilization was viewed as merely preliminary to more drastic measures for cleansing the Reich. Zahn warned in a statistical journal article: ‘population politics, according to the principles of racial hygiene, must promote valuable genetic stock, prevent the fertility of inferior life, and be aware of genetic degeneration. In other words, this means superior life selection on the one hand, and the eradication of genetically unwanted stock on the other hand. The ethnic biological diagnosis is indispensable to carry out this task.’

And Watson was well aware of what the technology was being used for. He regularly visited Germany, and even won an [Order of the German Eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_German_Eagle) award. This excerpt of a speech by Heidinger, the German lead of Dehomag (the IBM of Germany) spells it out in great detail.

> ‘The physician examines the human body and determines whether…all organs are working to the benefit of the entire organism,’ asserted Heidinger to a crowd of Nazi officials. ‘We [Dehomag] are very much like the physician, in that we dissect, cell by cell, the German cultural body. We report every individual characteristic…on a little card. These are not dead cards, quite to the contrary, they prove later on that they come to life when the cards are sorted at a rate of 25,000 per hour according to certain characteristics. These characteristics are grouped like the organs of our cultural body, and they will be calculated and determined with the help of our tabulating machine.
‘We are proud that we may assist in such task, a task that provides our nation’s Physician [Adolf Hitler] with the material he needs for his examinations. Our Physician can then determine whether the calculated values are in harmony with the health of our people. It also means that if such is not the case, our Physician can take corrective procedures to correct the sick circumstances…Our characteristics are deeply rooted in our race. Therefore, we must cherish them like a holy shrine which we will – and must – keep pure.
We have the deepest trust in our Physician and will follow his instructions in blind faith, because we know that he will lead our people to a great future.
Hail to our German people and der Führer!’
Most of Heidinger’s speech, along with a list of the invited Nazi Party officials, was rushed to Manhattan and immediately translated for Watson.
The IBM Leader cabled Heidinger a prompt note of congratulations for a job well done and sentiments well expressed.

And these other quotes:

> IBM was guided by one precept: know your customer, anticipate their needs. Watson stayed close to his customer with frequent visits to Germany and continuous daily micro-managed oversight of the business.

> Watson didn’t need to read about Aryanization in newspapers. He discovered it personally. In July 1935, Watson visited Berlin. That July, Nazi thugs ran wild in the streets of Berlin smashing the windows of fashionable Jewish stores. One of those department stores was owned by the Wertheims, family friends of the Watsons. The Watson family learned that to protect the store, Mr. Wertheim first transferred the property to his Aryan wife, but then ultimately decided to sell ‘for next to nothing’ and escape to Sweden. On another visit to Berlin, the Watsons and other IBM executives were invited to an elegant reception at the Japanese embassy. While sipping tea in the garden, a German diplomat boasted that the exquisite home formerly belonged to a Jew who fled the country. Such new ownership of greatly discounted homes was now common in Berlin.29

What strikes me the most about this project is the strict engineering requirements of this project. As a software engineer, we're often asked to go back and forth to define specifications for our software. It's extremely jarring to see this same behavior applied to such morally awful software.

> ‘Be Aware!’ reminded huge block-lettered signs facing each cluster of data entry clerks. Instructions were made clear and simple. Column 22 RELIGION was to be punched at hole 1 for Protestant, hole 2 for Catholic, or hole 3 for Jew. Columns 23 and 24 NATIONALITY were to be coded in row 10 for Polish speakers.24

> When Jews were discovered within the population, a special ‘Jewish counting card’ recorded the place of birth. These Jewish counting cards were processed separately.

> Then came the awesome sorting and resorting process for twenty-five categories of information cross-indexed and filtered through as many as thirty-five separate operations – by profession, by residence, by national origin, and a myriad of other traits. It was all to be correlated with information from land registers, community lists, and church authorities to create a fantastic new database. What emerged was a profession-by-profession, city-bycity, and indeed a block-by-block revelation of the Jewish presence.

> Now a lightning storm of anti-Jewish legislation and decrees restricting Jews from all phases of academic, professional, governmental, and commercial life would be empowered by the ability to target the Jews by individual name. Moreover, by cross-sorting the Jews revealed in Column 22 row 3 with Polish speakers identified in Columns 26 and 27 row 10, the Reich was able to identify who among the Jews would be its first targets for confiscation, arrest, imprisonment, and ultimately expulsion.

> Every day, transports of slave laborers were received. Prisoners were identified by descriptive Hollerith cards, each with columns and punched holes detailing nationality, date of birth, marital status, number of children, reason for incarceration, physical characteristics, and work skills. Sixteen coded categories of prisoners were listed in columns 3 and 4, depending upon the hole position: hole 3 signified homosexual, hole 9 for anti-social, hole 12 for Gypsy. Hole 8 designated a Jew. Printouts based on the cards listed the prisoners by personal code number as well. Column 34 was labeled ‘Reason for Departure.’ Code 2 simply meant transferred to another camp for continuing labor. Natural death was coded 3.
Execution was coded 4. Suicide coded 5. The ominous code 6 designated ‘special handling,’ the term commonly understood as extermination, either in a gas chamber, by hanging, or by gunshot.

> In one issue it reminded form processots to code Special Characteristics in the several columns field 12. Antisocial was to be coded 1 in one column. In a second column, diseases such as blindness were coded 1. Mental disease was 2. Cripples were 3. Deaf people were 5. Parents who had already been sterilized were to be noted with an ‘s’; children already sterilized ‘because of a parent’s sickness’ were noted ‘as’.84
Uniform codes were established for occupations. Factory workers were coded 19, hotel and guesthouse workers were 23, theatre artisans were 26.
Unemployed persons received the code number 28. These codes were handwritten into field 8 on the forms. Diseases were also coded: influenza was 3, lupus was 7, syphilis was 9, diabetes was 15; they were entered into field 9.

> So IBM production specifications were rigorous. Coniferous chemical pulp was milled, treated, and cured to create paper stock containing no more than 5 percent ash, and devoid of ground wood, calk fibers, processing chemicals, slime carbon, or other impurities that might conduct electricity and ‘therefore cause incorrect machine sensing.’ Residues, even in trace amounts, would accumulate on gears and other mechanisms, eventually causing jams and system shutdowns. Electrical testing to isolate defective sheets was mandatory. Paper, when cut, had to lie flat without curl or wrinkle, and feature a hard, smooth finish on either side that yielded a ‘good snap or rattle.’96
Tolerances necessitated laboratory-like mill conditions. Paper thickness: .0067 inches plus or minus only a microscopic .0005 inch. Width: 3.25 inches with a variance of plus .007 inches or minus .003 inches. Two basic lengths were produced: 5.265 inches and 7.375 inches, plus or minus only .005 inch in either case. Edges were to be cut at true right angles, corners at perfect 60 degree angles, with a quarter-inch along the top and three-eighths along the side, all free from blade creases with the paper grain running the length of the card. Relative humidity of 50 percent and a temperature of 70-75 degrees Fahrenheit was required at all times, including transport and storage.

> Ironically, while all understood the evil anti-Jewish process underway, virtually none comprehended the technology that was making it possible, The mechanics were less than a mystery, they were transparent.

 - Mention interviews
- Aids in communicating with non-software people (product manager, non tech teams, outside firms, etc...)
- Writing technical documentation, bug reports, emails, etc...
- Helps with understanding the larger scope of the impact of your work.
- Helps with reading and understanding documentation other people wrote.
- Helps create features and products that people will actually find useful. Help exit the "engineering" mindset.

Conclusion:
- What to make of all of this
- What to do for skills
- What to do if you're in charge of a program

Hey everyone! This post is a little bit of a deviation from what I normally talk about on this blog. It's normally a place where I like to talk and teach about certain technical topics that I'm interested in, such as interviews, learning python, studying CS in college, or starting web development. However, finding where a humanities education fits into computer science  is a topic I've been very interested in talking about, and so I hope it can spark some interesting conversations.



>The humanities can be described as the study of how people process and document the human experience. Since humans have been able, we have used philosophy, literature, religion, art, music, history and language to understand and record our world. These modes of expression have become some of the subjects that traditionally fall under the humanities umbrella. Knowledge of these records of human experience gives us the opportunity to feel a sense of connection to those who have come before us, as well as to our contemporaries.

### Saving the US Census Money

1)

> [Hollerith's] statistical feat caught the attention of the general scientific world and even the popular newspapers. His systems saved the Census Bureau some $5 million, or about a third of its budget. Computations were completed with unprecedented speed and added a dramatic new dimension to the entire nature of census taking. Now an army of census takers could posit 235 questions, including queries about the languages spoken in the household, the number of children living at home and elsewhere, the level of each family member’s schooling, country of origin, and scores of other traits. Suddenly, the government could profile its own population.
