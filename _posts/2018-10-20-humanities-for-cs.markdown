Hey everyone! This post is a little bit of a deviation from what I normally talk about on this blog. It's normally a place where I like to talk and teach about certain technical topics that I'm interested in, such as interviews, learning python, studying CS in college, or starting web development. However, finding where a humanities education fits into computer science  is a topic I've been very interested in talking about, and so I hope it can spark some interesting conversations.

# Introduction

Within the STEM community, it's fairly common to see people hold their education as more important than people who study humanities. These "STEM Majors" have an aura of superiority to them, thinking that because they

It's also common to assume that for jobs such as software engineering, the hard technical skills are extremely important, and to be competitive at your job you should focus on taking the hardest STEM classes you possibly can. Some technical schools double down on this ideology by making their CS students take classes in physics and chemistry, to instill a hardcore engineering mindset into their students.

I come from a unique position - my education at [Brandeis University](http://cs.brandeis.edu) was a bit different than what most people seemed to get for computer science. While other schools have fairly intense requirements for CS majors to take science, math, and hardcore CS classes, Brandeis' requirements were [fairly lax](Add link to Appendix). For a Bachelor of Arts, the only math class that was required was Discrete Math, and for a BS you just needed to add a few more to that. If someone wanted a rigorous CS education, it was mostly up to them to seek out the hard classes in machine learning, 

> Brandeis students may choose from a variety of majors and minors offered in four broad areas: the creative arts, the humanities, the sciences and the social sciences. A number of these programs are interdisciplinary by design and draw faculty from several different departments. Nearly half of our undergraduates pursue a double major, often in fields on opposite ends of the academic spectrum. Students may pursue up to a triple-major and/or triple-minor.

You've probably seen it before -  


Why a humanities education is important for Software Engineers:

- Aids in communicating with other software engineers.
 - Mention interviews
- Aids in communicating with non-software people (product manager, non tech teams, outside firms, etc...)
- Writing technical documentation, bug reports, emails, etc...
- Helps with understanding the larger scope of the impact of your work.
- Helps with reading and understanding documentation other people wrote.
- Helps create features that people will actually find useful.
