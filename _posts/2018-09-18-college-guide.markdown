Hey everyone! I know normally these blogs are geared towards an older audience, but I'm hoping to use this blog as a way to make computer science more inclusive at all levels! So to all my high school age readers, welcome, and I hope this post is useful to you! If this is out of your age range, I'd love for you to still read this and share your own experiences, as everyone's experience with college is unique and personal.

I was asked to talk at two separate high school AP Computer Science classes, and I talked to the students about what it really means to study Computer Science in college. Being a recent college graduate, I still remember a lot of the questions and anxieties I had about choosing a college and what to expect. I had taken one programming class in my junior year, and beside that I really didn't know what computer science really was, or what it meant to be studying it really. I decided to write this post so that I can spread my experience to many more people than just two classrooms, and make sure y'all know what you're getting into!

Please let me know what you think in the comments below, either as someone looking into college or as someone whose been through the process. You can always [shoot me an email](mailto:arya@aryaboudaie.com) as well! If you're a teacher, let me know if you'd like me to come talk to your class :)

# What exactly is Computer Science?

So you want to study computer science in college, but what exactly is computer science? Maybe you have some programming experience and really like doing it, so you want to keep doing more of it. Programming is definitely a great skill to have for CS, but don't think that programming is all you do in a computer science major. A famous quote that's (wrongly) attributed to Edsger W. Dijkstra goes something like this:

> Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.

The quote is trying to say that while programming is used frequently in computer science, it is just a tool to get to the real science, not the end goal itself. Another common confusion I've noticed is that people think computer science is about languages: learning Python in one class, Java in another, SQL in the next, Haskell in another...

Most colleges will have an introduction to programming class, where you will learn a programming language and how to program. However, after this first class, your other classes will not be that laser focused on the language itself. If a class requires you to use a new language (because it's a better tool for understanding the material of the class), then you'll be learning it quick with the expectation that your previous programming knowledge will help expadite the process.

So now that I've talked about what computer science __isnt__, let me talk about what it is.

# (Quick) Introduction to Myself

Before I start giving advice, I figure that I should give you an overview of my whole experience with programming. Whenever you hear advice from someone, you should know where they're coming from, since that's where their advice comes from! So let me give you a little introduction!

I started programming my junior year of high school. I had tried learning programming before, but it's not like today where there are so many resources online for that, so I was pretty stuck. My high school did not offer a regular computer science class, but we had one teacher that was extremely enthusiastic about teaching coding, so he created his own class called "Computational Math Analysis." It was a really cool class, where we learned all of the topics others were learning in pre-calculus, but with the programming language Python.

I was a pretty math-minded person, so this way of teaching programming really resonated with me, and really made me want to learn as much as I possibly could about programming. As soon as I got started, I knew that I loved solving coding problems, and I would blow off my other work to solve problems on Coding Bat or Project Euler.

I owe a lot of my growth in programming, love of computer science, and thoughts about CS education to this teacher. Before taking this class, I didn't think I was really good at any specific topics, and had no idea what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. After this class, I still didn't really know what "computer science" was, but I knew that I at least wanted to give it a shot! Not much happened my senior year of college. Despite knowing that I wanted to study CS, my school really didn't have anywhere to continue after that class unless you wanted to join robotics (which with my heavy band schedule I did not want to do). I tried to petition my school to create an AP CSA class, but they would not implement that until the year after I left. 

In terms of colleges, I really did not know that much about college. My GPA was fairly mediocre, so I knew I wouldn't get into anywhere amazing. I pretty much just applied to everywhere under the sun, with the hopes that one of them would work out with financial aid as well as have a good computer science program. I really should have done more research at this point, but everything surprisingly worked out.

I only ended up applying to the school I ended up going to, Brandeis University, because my best friend's parents met there and thought I would like it. Brandeis is a fairly small research university in Waltham Massachusetts 


Now that I've gone through my story, here are my tips:

# Tip 1: Find a good school FOR YOU.

My most important tip is to try and find a school that will be a good fit for you. A lot of people think that the best school they could go to is the one with the best connections and the highest rank on
