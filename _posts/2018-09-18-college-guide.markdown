Hey everyone! I know normally these blogs are geared towards an older audience, but I'm hoping to use this blog as a way to make computer science more inclusive at all levels! So to all my high school age readers, welcome, and I hope this post is useful to you! If this is out of your age range, I'd love for you to still read this and share your own experiences, as everyone's experience with college is unique and personal.

I was asked to talk at two separate high school AP Computer Science classes, and I talked to the students about what it really means to study Computer Science in college. Being a recent college graduate, I still remember a lot of the questions and anxieties I had about choosing a college and what to expect. I had taken one programming class in my junior year, and beside that I really didn't know what computer science really was, or what it meant to be studying it really. I decided to write this post so that I can spread my experience to many more people than just two classrooms, and make sure y'all know what you're getting into!

# Introduction to Myself

Before I start giving advice, I figure that I should give you an overview of my whole experience with programming. Whenever you hear advice from someone, you should know where they're coming from, since that's where their advice comes from! So let me give you a little introduction!

I started programming my junior year of high school. I had tried learning programming before, but it's not like today where there are so many resources online for that, so I was pretty stuck. My high school did not offer a regular computer science class, but we had one teacher that was extremely enthusiastic about teaching coding, so he created his own class called "Computational Math Analysis." It was a really cool class, where we learned all of the topics others were learning in pre-calculus, but with the programming language Python.

I was a pretty math-minded person, so this way of teaching programming really resonated with me, and really made me want to learn as much as I possibly could about programming. As soon as I got started, I knew that I loved solving coding problems, and I would blow off my other work to solve problems on Coding Bat or Project Euler.

I owe a lot of my growth in programming, love of computer science, and thoughts about CS education to this teacher. Before taking this class, I didn't think I was really good at any specific topics, and had no idea what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. After this class, I still didn't really know what "computer science" was, but I knew that I at least wanted to give it a shot!

Not much happened my senior year of college. Despite knowing that I wanted to study CS<
